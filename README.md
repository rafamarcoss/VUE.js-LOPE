# VUE.js-LOPE
Project Description: Development of a SPA (Single Page Application) website that will display information about the different subjects of the higher education program we are currently taking. The website will include various modules to show the days of the week and the subjects scheduled for each day.
We will be organizing the project using the Trello platform, where we will have more detailed information about the project and a list of pending tasks.
