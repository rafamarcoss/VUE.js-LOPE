# VUE.js-LOPE
Project Description: Development of a SPA (Single Page Application) website that will display information about the different subjects of the higher education program we are currently taking. 
The website will include various modules to show the days of the week and the subjects scheduled for each day.
We will be organizing the project using the Trello platform, where we will have more detailed information about the project and a list of pending tasks.


We have developed a web design using CSS to display all the subjects on the main page. The page is structured as follows: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5173cce-0a5c-4141-a3e3-bb3dba3ffdc5) 

The images displayed and the subject information are fetched from a MySQL database running locally via XAMPP. We use a PHP API in combination with the GET method to retrieve the subject name, professor, description, and image from the database. 
We have also learned how to make API calls using the Postman tool, which enables us to test GET, POST, DELETE, and other HTTP methods. 
Our current objective is to present the project in class, and we are contemplating how to make the web page accessible on the local network so that others can interact with the page during the presentation. 
Throughout this process, we are gaining an understanding of web application structure, which includes a frontend, API for handling requests, and a backend with a database that interacts with the API. 
Additionally, we are learning team collaboration techniques and exploring new programming languages and frameworks. As we are not yet junior developers, our primary focus is on grasping new concepts and technologies.
We have created a web design using CSS to display all subjects on the main page. The screenshot above shows how the page looks. The images and subject information are retrieved from a MySQL database running on a local XAMPP server. 
We built a PHP-based API (using CHAT-GPT, we don't know about PHP) that handles GET requests to obtain the name, professor, description, and images from the database. We learned how to use Postman to test various API methods, including GET, POST, and DELETE.

Our current goal is to present this project in class, and we plan to enable access over the local network so that our classmates can test the webpage during the presentation. 
Throughout this process, we have been learning about the structure of a typical web application, which involves a frontend, an API for handling requests, and a backend database. 
We are also focusing on teamwork and gaining familiarity with new programming languages and frameworks. While we are not yet at a junior developer level, our primary objective is to deepen our understanding of these concepts and technologies.
